PROJECT TITLE : ALERT ME : AN AUTOMATED NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
TEAM MEMBERS : 
VANSH (TEAM LEADER )
ANIKET (FRONTEND DEVELOPER )
ANISHH (BACKEND DEVELOPER )

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : Alert Me is an automated notification system designed to monitor user data on critical websites. Users register their names and IDs, and the system continuously tracks this data. If any user data disappears due to technical issues, errors, or manual changes, Alert Me instantly notifies all affected users via email and WhatsApp. Built with a user-friendly front-end and a robust back-end powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this solution ensures data security, user trust, and quick response to data inconsistencies."

SQLite	Lightweight database (alertme.db stores user emails/OTPs)
SMTP (via smtplib)	Sends emails (OTPs, alerts via Gmail)
SSL/TLS	Secures email transmission (Gmail‚Äôs SMTP)
üîß Development Tools
Technology	Purpose
